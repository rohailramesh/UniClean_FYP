The folder has to main sub-folders: backend and frontend

Backend:
Flask is used in the backend to host the model where the user's request is sent and a response is sent back to the frontend. A virtual environment must be enabled and then the requirements.txt file must be ran whilst being in the backend sub-folder to install all the necessary dependencies. 
This can be done through this command: pip install -r requirements. txt

Additionally, in the backend, a jupyter notebook is also provided with the ouputs of each cell that show the process of training the model

To run the backend, the IP address must be changes at two different places when the location of local device changes. Just navigate to your wifi settings and copy the current IP address

Frontend:
React Native is used on the frontend so once you change into the directory, it is important to execute the command 'npm install to install' the node modules folder.
